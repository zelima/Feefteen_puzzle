Puzzle game

Code was written as project for Python learning course "Principals of Computing" by Rice university (Online Course)
I was providen with first two parts of the code and the GUI class, but since i'm using pygame for GUI, I had to modify 90% of code as well.

I don'thave any right's on this game and wrote it only for my own educational and practical porposes.

Have Fun
